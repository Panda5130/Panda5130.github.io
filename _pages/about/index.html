I graduated high school in India, as fairly well-scoring student, a national swimmer, a volunteer for animal welfare in my locale, and a rock and metal guitar fanatic. I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor and my ever evolving interests make it harder and harder for me to feel in touch with all facets of my personality. Aside from preserving the past, I simply collect my thoughts and experices in one place, this website!</p> </body></html>
